# Boxing Studio Platform 🥊

A secure and simple web platform for managing a boxing studio.
The focus is on **clarity, usability, and security**, not visual complexity.

The public website is intentionally minimal so that even children can understand it,
while the underlying infrastructure follows professional software engineering practices.
